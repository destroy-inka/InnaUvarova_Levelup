Everytime I Die
Children of Bodom
Ow
Oh
The faint blaze of the candle of my life
Slowly dying like a fire in a pouring rain
No sparks of hope inside
No shooting stars on my sky
On broken wings, no flying high
Another night, another demise
Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice
You'll let the wind blow out the light
'Cause it gets more painful everytime I die
Out of strength to fight
I cannot take another night
I cannot take it no more
Lust of light slips through my fingers
Likeâ€¦
